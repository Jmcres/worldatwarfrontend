        description: "As the bombers of the Eighth Air Force fought their way deep into Hitler's German heartland, it was the Mustang that cleared the skies of Luftwaffe fighters. No other combat airplane of the war could fly as high, go as far and fight as hard as the mighty Mustang. In the skilled hands of young USAAF pilots, it took on all corners and accounted for more kills than any other Allied aircraft.Faced with imminent invasion in 1939 and desperately short of fighters, the Royal Air Force asked North American Aviation to produce urgently the existing but obsolete P-40 Warhawk. But instead the company designed, built and flew a new airplane in just 117 days - the Mustang. Using an existing Allison engine and the latest laminar-flow wing, the new fighter immediately went into service with the RAF. In December 1941 America joined the war and it too needed good fighters fast. So the USAAF took the basic RAF Mustang, re-armed it with four machine-guns and added an uprated engine. It was a good performer, but couldn't operate well alongside the high-flying long-range bomber. By 1944, the aircraft used the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine had a new bubble cockpit and increased firepower to six 12.7 mm (0.50 cal) machine-guns. It was now the best fighter in the war and fought superbly in all theatres as fighter, fighter-bomber and reconnaissance platform. It was loved by its aircrews and no fewer than 281 Mustang pilots became aces by scoring five kills apiece.",

          description: "Vought's F4U Corsair was one of the finest fighters ever built. At first thought too powerful to fly from carrier decks, the Corsair weaved a path of destruction in the battle after battle during World War II, totally outclassing the much-feared Japanese Zero. With its instantly recognisable gull- wing shape and its great speed and firepower, the Corsair was still coming off the production line in 1953, one of the last of the great piston engined fighters. The fighter which took shape in designer Rex Beisel's drawing board in 1938 was a monster. The prototype Vought F4U Corsair, flown on 29 May 1940, was the heaviest shipborne fighter built to that time. It was tough, fast and very manoeuvrable but early pilots encountered handling problems at low speeds and the restricted view made carrier landing very tricky. As a result, the first Corsairs in combat were flown with enormous success by land-based Marines. Modified with a raised seat and bulged canopy, Corsairs were flying from British carriers in 1943 and from US Navy carriers by 1944 and racked up an impressive score of aerial victories against Japan's best fighters. Corsairs using bombs and rockets paved the way for the final battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The Royal Navy also used the Corsair to great effect in the Pacific, attacking Japanese oil refineries and airfields. Vought's remarkabke fighter also manufactured by Brewster and Goodyear, was still an important component in US naval air power during the Korean War. One Corsair even shot doen a MiG-15 jet fighter.",

          description: "Conceived in 1937 as a complement to the Bf 109, Focke-Wulf's Fw 190s became a potent threat to Allied air power in every region where the Luftwaffe fought. Fw 190s inflicted cruel punishment on Flying Fortress and Liberator crews, and were almost impossible to defeat until the long range P-51 Mustang finally became available in 1944 to escort bombers to their targets. As a fighter bomber and anti tank aircraft, the Fw 190 was Germany's best air to ground fighter. The Fw 190a-8 was used extensively in Defence of the Riech operations during 1944. Heavily armed with four cannon and two machine guns it wreaked havoc upon US daylight bombers. The long nosed Tank Ta 152 versions of the Fw 190 reached air speeds as high as 760 km/h (472 mph) and might have altered the outcome of the war if more than 93 had been built before hostilities ended. No one who fought in the hotly contested skies of Europe will forget the feats of Fw 190 pilots such as Oberleutnant Otto Kittel, the Luftwaffe's fourth ranking ace, who scored most of his 267 victories in theweaponsystem. It is truly one of the great fighters of all time. Kurt Tank's superb Focke-Wulf Fw 190 first saw combat over the English Channel in September 1941. The new fighter was a shock to the RAF, being faster and more agile than the Spitfire. Known as the 'Butcher Bird', the Fw 190 went to become a dominant force in aerial combat in Europe, performing with equal distinction as a fighter and as the Luftwaffe's most important ground attack machine.",

        description: "The Messerschmitt Me 262 reached the battlefield too late to have a profound effect on the outcome of the war, but it was one of those wonder weapons which awed the world and had completely revolutionize the face of air superiority warfare. Powered by the Junkers Jumo 004-B1 twin jet engines, the Me 262 was easily the fastest and most advanced aircraft in the world. Armed with forward firing cannons and unguided R4M rockets, this jet fighter could shoot down any Allied aircraft almost with impunity. This incredible aircraft achieved unconventional performance, far beyond the capabilities of any aircraft then in service, or under development. It was only through massive Allied bombings which laid waste to the German war industry which hindered production of this revolutionary aircraft. The Me 262 was first conceived in 1939, but it was not initially planned to be a jet plane. When the first prototype flew on April 4 1941, it was still powered by a conventional piston engine, the Junkers Jumo 210G. The first jet powered flight took place on July 18 1942, where it had a tail wheel configuration and when it landed, unburned fuel was prone to ignite making landings very hazardous. The unsatisfactory layout was then changed to a fully retractable tricycle design, where it became the first production model, the Me 262A-1a “Schwalbe” (Swallow). Powered by twin Junkers Jumo 004B-1 turbojets, each engine delivered about 1,900 lbs of thrust, making this interceptor the fastest aircraft in the world. These early engines had a service life of only 25 hours, and had to be overhauled every 10 hours. The armament comprised of four Mk 108A 30mm cannons in the nose, while the Me 262A-1b version carried an additional 24 R4M 55mm unguided rockets under its wings. Although the Me 262 handled well at high speeds, it was sluggish and awkward at low speeds.",

          description: "Having seen extensive service during the Spanish Civil War, early-model Bf 109s had given way to the Bf 109E by the spring of 1940. The Bf 109E series offered superior diving performance and various armament options, including the common layout of two cannon plus two machine-guns. The result was a highly effective fighter, but the operational circumstances of the Battle of Britain meant the odds were stacked heavily against it. The German fighter pilots knew that their aircraft had an edge in performance over the British Hurricanes and Spitfires and their twin cannon had proved highly effective. But when they were forced to escort the Luftwaffe's bombers further inland, they began to lose their initial advantage. As long as they were allowed to cross the Channel at altitudes of around 9000 m (29,000 ft) and engage the British fighters in open combat, the 'Emils' more than held their own. Tied though, they lost their independence and before the introduction of the drop tank equipped Bf 109E-7, they could spend no more than 30 minutes over England. Their pilots faced other disadvantages. British radar could detect the approaching formations, giving the RAF's fighters a tactical advantage. All missions involved long overwater flights and the strain on the Luftwaffe fighter force proved too much. In September the Luftwaffe switched its efforts to night raids on London",

          description: "The Spitfire is the most famous British aircraft of all time. Although less numerous than the Hawker Hurricane during the Battle of Britain, it is nevertheless remembered as the sleek, throughbred fighting machine that turned the tide during that campaign. The Spitfire is among the fastest and most manoeuvrable fighters of World War II and served in every combat there. Supermarine designer Reginald Mitchell created a small, graceful fighter with elliptical wing and eight guns in the wings, able to fire without being hindered by the propeller. The immortal Spitfire thus became not merely one of the best-performing fighters of all time, but also one of the best-looking. Although never a long-ranged aircraft, the Spitfire was a championin an air-to-air duel. Spitfires were routinely dived at velocities approaching the speed of sound, faster than any of the German jets. Merlin engines were used in the early versions of the Spitfire, later supplanted by the more powerful Griffon. Late Spitfires introduced a bubble canopy which made one of history's most beautiful aircraft even more appealing. The carrier-based Seafire, derived from the Spitfire Mk V, made a vital contribution to British naval air power until new American carrier fighters appeared later in the war. The Spitfire also found a new role as a tactical fighter-bomber.",

          description: "When Imperial Japanese forces burst like a tidal wave accross the Pacific in December 1941, they were spearheaded by the amazing Mitsubishi Zero. It was not new even then, but Western experts had shrugged off reports that Japan possessed a world-class warplane. No American fighter matched the Zero in firepower, agility or range and in the early stages of the war it was absolutely dominant. The notion that Japan could produce a superb combat craft was so alien to the West that ordinary fighters like the Nakajima Ki-43 'Oscar' were mistakenly called 'Zeroes' and overestimated by besieged Americans. Colonel Claire Chennault's 'Flying Tigers' in China never saw a Zero but their combat reports fuelled growing alarm as the Japanese navy swept across the Pacific with squadrons of the real thing: the A6M, designed by Mitsubishi's Jiro Horikoshi.  The early successes of the Zero were due in part to its light weight, power, armament and manoeuvrability - but also partly to its brilliant and courageous pilots, many of whom fell along the way and proved difficult to replace. The initial success was not to last for long. Within two years, Japan's adversaries developed new warplanes like the hard-hitting Grumman F6F Hellcat, while only minor improvements were made to the Zero. The tide turned, Japan's situation deteriorated and in the end as defeat closed in, this great fighter was reduced to the role of kamikaze - suicide - aircraft.",

          description: "Few memories of war have endured more than the high-pitched scream of the Junkers Ju 87 'Stuka' swooping to strike its prey with claws of gunfire and bomb blast. This dive-bomber made its reputaion during the Polish campaign, where it excelled at close support of ground troops. The Ju 87 fought on every frontbetween 1939 and 1945. Adaptable and cheap, the 'Stuka' became a potent anti-tank machine on the Eastern Front.  Designed to work closely with the Wehrmacht, the Ju 87 could attack with deadly accuracy, acting as a kind of highly mobile artillery. Swarming down on Poland, Norway, France and the Low Countries, the 'Stuka' (from the word Sturzkampfflugzeug, or dive-bomber) left a trail of devastation and stuck terror even in the hearts of seasoned combat troops.  The Ju 87's invincible reputation took a hammering, however, when it came up against Hurricanes and Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. The distinctive aircraft with its gull wings and fixed landing dear proved slow and highly vulnerable to modern fighter opposition. Even so, it remained a rugged and reliable machine and was used extensively on the Eastern Front. The Ju 87 destroyed more tanks than any aircraft except for Russia's Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik.  From 1939, every Ju 87 was made by Weser at Tempelhof. Improvements to the 'Stuka' saw it gaining more power and better protection, but it was never to overcome its vulnerability to fighters.",

          description: "An incredible 36,000 I1-2 Shturmoviks were manufactured, making this the most numerous military aircraft in history. The I1-2 was called a 'flying tank',because it was havily armoured and had great firepower from its cannon and rockets.  A low-wing metal craft with wood in the aft fuselage, the I1-2 began as a single-seater. At first production difficulties plagued its builders. Premier Josef Stalin cabled factory workers saying,'The Red Army needs the I1-2 as it needs air and bread.' Though handicapped by the war, Soviet industry rose to the occassion. In February 1942 a two-seat I1-2 was introduced. This had a rear gunner under an extended canopy. Production versions appeared at the Front, while single-seaters were converted in the field. The I1-2 could carry 1,200 kg (2,640 lbs) of bombs over a distance of 400 km (250 mil) and was agile enough to give attacking fighters a good run for their money. Even more potent was the I1-10 Shturmovik, which arrived just as the war was ending. The aircraft saw extensive action in Korea with the Communist forces. The Shturmovik an armoured attack warplane is a uniquely Russian concept. The IIyushin II-2 entered service in 1941, only months before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. IIyushin began designing the aircraft by fitting armour around a pilot and engine, and then thinking about the aerodynamics. The II-2 and the developed II-10 were used on a vast scale and proved to be devastating ground-attack weapons. The Shturmovik became a legend to the Soviet public, who saw it as an instrument of salvation and cheered its successes in battle.",

The definitive P-40N entered production in 1943, and reached US Army Air Force squadrons in March 1944. By then, the P-40 was not a world class pursuit ship. To some extent it was purposely assigned to secondary theatres so that more advanced warplanes 9P-38, P-47, P-51) could fly where the US perceived its first priorities. But none of this meant much to American pilots slogging in the Aleutians, Australians in New Guinea, or South Africans in Libya; they took this solid, rugged fighter and made the most of what they had.",
